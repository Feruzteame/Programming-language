                 <p>
                    JavaScript . JavaScript is a programming language commonly used in web development. It
                    was originally developed by Netscape as a means to add dynamic and interactive elements
                    to websites. ... Like server-side scripting languages, such as PHP and ASP, JavaScript
                    code can be inserted anywhere within the HTML of a webpage.

                <p>
                    Python is a high-level programming language designed to be easy to read and 
                    simple to implement. It is open source, which means it is free to use, even
                    for commercial applications. ... Python is considered a scripting language, 
                    like Ruby or Perl and is often used for creating Web applications and dynamic 
                    Web content.

                    Java is a high-level programming language developed by Sun Microsystems. ...
                     Instead, Java programs are interpreted by the Java Virtual Machine, or JVM, 
                     which runs on multiple platforms. This means all Java programs are multiplatform
                     and can run on different platforms, including Macintosh, Windows, and Unix 
                     computers.

                     Bell Labs. C ++ adds object-oriented features to its predecessor, C. C ++ is 
                     one of the most popular programming language for graphical applications, such 
                     as those that run in Windows and Macintosh environments.

                <p>
                    Although numerous computer languages are used for writing computer applications, 
                    the computer programming language, C, is the most popular language worldwide. 
                    Everything from microcontrollers to operating systems is written in C since it's
                     very flexible and versatile, allowing maximum control with minimal commands.

                    used to communicate with a database. According to ANSI (American National 
                    Standards Institute), it is the standard language for relational database 
                    management systems.

                 <h4>Ruby</h4>
                 <p>
                    Ruby is most used for building web applications. However, it is a general-purpose
                     language similar to Python, so it has many other applications like data analysis,
                      prototyping, and proof of concepts. Probably the most obvious implementation of 
                      Ruby is Rails web, the development framework built with Ruby .

                 <p>
                    About Swift. Swift is a general-purpose programming language built using a modern approach to 
                    safety, performance, and software design patterns. The goal of the Swift project is to create 
                    the best available language for uses ranging from systems programming, to mobile and desktop 
                    apps, scaling up to cloud services.

                 <h4>TypeScript</h4>
                 <p>
                    TypeScript provides highly productive development tools for JavaScript IDEs and
                     practices, like static checking. TypeScript makes code easier to read and 
                     understand. With TypeScript , we can make a huge improvement over plain 
                     JavaScript. TypeScript gives us all the benefits of ES6 (ECMAScript 6), plus 
                     more productivity.
